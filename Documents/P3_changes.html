        <h2>The changes we have made</h2>
          <div class="changes">
            <p>
              We were happy with our original design. However, the colors on the
              desktop design were a little dull and off-theme. Additionally, we
              decided to change the gradient background on the mobile design and
              add some gifs to liven up the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>index.html:</b> The changes we made to the index page are
              mainly on the desktop version. The most noticeable changes are the
              change of background color on the main page and the nav bar.
              Additionally, we removed the footer, added the contact link to the
              nav bar, and replaced the back-to-the-top button with an up-arrow
              button. Furthermore, we added additional padding to the top of the
              color section.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>about.html:</b> Changes made to the about page are mainly the
              background, as mentioned above. We planned to have a gradient
              background on both mobile and desktop; however, this felt boring
              and inconsistent with the rest of the page. After some discussion,
              we agreed to have the same background color theme on the entire
              website. Furthermore, we added a gif on the mobile page. Also, we
              decided to continue with the wave theme from the main page on the
              desktop to make the feel of the entire website more consistent. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>contact.html:</b> We made a few changes to the contact page. We
              changed the background on the desktop version to some waves
              instead of the gradient here. We added the wave as an image in the
              main body. We also made changes to the mobile CSS. We removed the
              form on mobile in favor of just having the contact email as a
              clickable link that would open a new email draft. We also added a
              gif on the mobile page. Everything else has stayed the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>JavaScript:</b> We also decided to create a modules folder that
              contains all modules used in the other JavaScript files. These
              file are imported and used in the js folder. Furthermore, we
              decided to write our JavaScript in multiple files to keep the
              JavaScript structured. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>colorElementCreator.js:</b> This file contains the function
              which creates the color section on the main page, after user has
              clicked the "genrate" button. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>ColorHandler.js:</b> This file contain a class, which is
              responsible for handling all color calculations and contain
              methods for generating the color schemes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>colorInputHandler.js:</b> This file checks if the inputted hex
              is valid and changes the background-color and text-color based on
              the given hexcode.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>PaletteGenerator.js:</b> This file contains a child class of
              the colorHandler class. This file is responsible for generating
              color palettes and stores them in a "palettes" property. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>index.js:</b> The index file handles actions when the generate
              button is clicked. It is responsible for calling the
              "colorInputHandler" on user input.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>mailHandler.js:</b> This file retrieves values of the input
              field and text area on "contact.html". Thereafter, it opens mail
              client with prefilled subject and body.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>navGenerator.js:</b> This file creates the nav-bar and sets the
              active link, based on the URL. It also manages classes for the
              "hamburger" menu on mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Hosting:</b> Because we had to make our GitHub repository
              private due to plagiarism checks, the website is hosted no
              folk.ntnu.no.
