						<h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
						<p>
							The purpose of the website is to provide color schemes based upon
							a user given color.
						</p>
						<p>
							This will be accomplished by having a input field on the home
							page, where the user can enter the color they intend to use for
							the scheme. The colors will then be generated by javascript on the
							backend, and thereafter be shown as div's with a background color
							on the website. The div's will have input fields (for easy
							copying), that is read only, showing the hex value of the colors.
							The website will be quite simple. However, the design should be
							quite adequate.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="audience">
						<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
						<p>
							The intended audience for the website is designers, UI developers,
							and artists. Because of the intended audience, the graphics and
							design of the website should be good-looking. Furthermore, if
							users find the site easy to use, they will be more likely to
							return to it.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-of-site">
						<h3>Content of site</h3>
						<p>
							Home page is a basic input field and a button. The main page
							should also have a nav bar and some nice artwork in the
							background. Upon clicking the button, the backend should generate
							some color schemes, and add classes to html elements, to show it's
							content. Therefore, the content of the home page expands after
							generating the color schemes. This will of course be applied to
							mobile users as well.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="functional-non-functional-requirements">
						<h3>Requirements</h3>
						<h4>Functional Requirements</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The website should accept user input of a color.</li>
							<li>The user should be able to navigate to subpages.</li>
							<li>
								The user should be able to copy the hex codes of the generated
								colors.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Non-functional Requirements</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The generator must load in less than 1 second</li>
							<li>The website should load in less than 2 seconds</li>
							<li>
								Mobile users should be able to navigate anywhere on the page in
								2 clicks. However, PC users should be able to do the same in one
								click.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="final-location">
						<h3>Final Location</h3>
						<p>
							The final location will be on
							<a target="_blank" href="https://TheFakeKiwi.github.io"
								>https://TheFakeKiwi.github.io</a
							>. It will be hosted on GitHub Pages. The reason for this is that
							we don't have a real client.
