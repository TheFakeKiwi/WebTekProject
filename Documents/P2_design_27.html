                    <h3>Purpose, Goals and audience</h3>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the website is to provide color schemes based upon
                        a user given color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will be accomplished by having a input field on the home
                        page, where the user can enter the color they intend to use for
                        the scheme. The colors will then be generated by javascript on the
                        backend, and thereafter be shown as div's with a background color
                        on the website. The div's will have input fields (for easy
                        copying), that is read only, showing the hex value of the colors.
                        The website will be quite simple. However, the design should be
                        quite adequate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The intended audience for the website is designers, UI developers,
                        and artists. Because of the intended audience, the graphics and
                        design of the website should be good-looking. Furthermore, if
                        users find the site easy to use, they will be more likely to
                        return to it.

                        1. homepage - index.html: <br>
                           The homepage will be the first page that users see when they enter our site. They will be greeted 
                           by a nice background of an ocean scene that includes an input field for a color, and a button to 
                           generate the palettes.
                        <br>
                           The homepage will be the backbone of our site, and the page users will spend 
                           their time on. The site will be set up in such a way where the users do not need to enter any other      
                           page than the homepage to make use of the generation function.
                        <br>
                           The function will generate a complimentary, an analogous, a split-complimentary and a triadic  
                           color palette based on the color spesified by the user. If not specified, it will be chosen at
                           random. When generated, the page will take a bit to load, before auto-scrolling down to the first 
                           generated palette, before the user can scroll to see the others.

                        Plan: Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline
                        the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible
                        for them. Include a list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her
                        partner has built. Include a complete list of everything you need to get from your
                        client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and when you expect to get them. To the greatest
                        extent you can, try to have all of these things by the time your design is done so that
                        nothing will delay your coding.
