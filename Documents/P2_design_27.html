                    <h3>Purpose, Goals and audience</h3>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the website is to provide color schemes based upon
                        a user given color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will be accomplished by having a input field on the home
                        page, where the user can enter the color they intend to use for
                        the scheme. The colors will then be generated by javascript on the
                        backend, and thereafter be shown as div's with a background color
                        on the website. The div's will have input fields (for easy
                        copying), that is read only, showing the hex value of the colors.
                        The website will be quite simple. However, the design should be
                        quite adequate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The intended audience for the website is designers, UI developers,
                        and artists. Because of the intended audience, the graphics and
                        design of the website should be good-looking. Furthermore, if
                        users find the site easy to use, they will be more likely to
                        return to it.

                    <p>
                        1. homepage - index.html: <br>
                           The homepage will be the first page that users see when they enter our site. They will be greeted 
                           by a nice background of an ocean scene that includes an input field for a color, and a button to 
                           generate the palettes.
                        <br>
                           The homepage will be the backbone of our site, and the page users will spend 
                           their time on. The site will be set up in such a way where the users do not need to enter any other      
                           page than the homepage to make use of the generation function.
                        <br>
                           The function will generate a complimentary, an analogous, a split-complimentary and a triadic  
                           color palette based on the color spesified by the user. If not specified, it will be chosen at
                           random. When generated, the page will take a bit to load, before auto-scrolling down to the first 
                           generated palette, before the user can scroll to see the others. 

                        <br><br>

                        2. about - about.html   <br>
                        The about page will be accessable from the nav bar. The page will include information about the site
                        such as the fact that it is a school project, what it's designed to do and things such as.
                        The page should be nice on the eyes and will also have some pictures/illustrations. 

                        <br><br>

                        3. contact - contact.html <br>
                        From the footer you will be able to go to our contact page. It will include a form with a subject, body
                        and a button to submit. When the button is pressed it will open the default email service of the user
                        with a prefilled document including us as the reciever. <br>
                        The page will also include some nice artwork!
