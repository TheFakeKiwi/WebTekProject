## How to GitHub

### Create a new branch

If you wish to create a new branch, the command you would use is:

```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

when the branch is created, type the following into your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Once you have done this, the branch should show up in the GitHub repository.

### Switch to another branch

If you are on the main branch and want to switch to a different branch, you would type:

```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```

After switching to a different branch, the first time you commit, you need to run `git push` with the `-u` flag.

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### Remove deleted branches

If you have deleted a branch on GitHub, that branch would not be removed locally on your computer. To do this, you would type:

```bash
git remote prune origin
```
