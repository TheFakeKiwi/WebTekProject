                    The questionnaire consisted of eight questions, where six
                    were obligatory. We reached out to the testers by creating a
                    simple, readable Google Form. We shared the form with
                    friends, family, and students and asked them kindly to test
                    it and give their opinions on our website.
                    <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSey8xULpbHPlHKVkqG7rvl-phhIYI6n9139CmyzpHRLTHy-wQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google
                    Form</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As usual, the first three questions asked about the tester's
                    gender, age, and position. We then asked about the devices
                    they used to test the website and their browser. The last
                    two questions were about whether the testers experienced any
                    issues, and if they did, we asked them to describe them.

                <h2>Testing Audience</h2>
                <p>We sent the website around to other students studying web
                development and technologies, among others, that might be
                outside our intended audience. Although 87.5% of our testers
                were students (landing in the 18-24 range), we also had one
                project leader, one IT specialist, and one director making up
                the final 12.5%. The testers outside our intended audience had
                trouble figuring out our color generator used hex codes, which
                we addressed.</p>

                <h2>Testing Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    Most users tested our website using Google Chrome and
                    Safari; This made up 70% of the user base.    Other websites
                    used by testers were firefox, brave, and Samsung internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Results on whether the testers were using mobile or desktop
                    devices were almost an even 50 - 50 split. Testers used
                    mobile devices 57% of the time, and they used desktops 47%
                    of the time. Although we didn't have a checkbox available
                    for tablets, we can conclude from the results that there was
                    one tablet user among the testers.

                    In short, most of the feedback was good. Multiple people
                    mentioned that they thought we had a clean layout and
                    enjoyed the design and concept. However, the concept also
                    seemed to confuse some as repetitive feedback was: "What is
                    the website supposed to do?". We also got multiple feedback
                    on the font color decision in the index.html, where the
                    light blue part used to be white and blend in with the
                    background, making it hard to read. Furthermore, some
                    reviewers wanted clarification on defining colors using hex
                    code. We also got some feedback regarding the marketing, as
                    the site's name made them expect something more connected to
                    the ocean.

                    <li>Could have been more apparent what the website is.</li>
                    <li>Nice design, liked it, hard to choose color based on
                    numbers.</li>
                    <li>Great job! Super clean and clear!</li>
                    <li>See the color changes when you write the code, but it is
                    difficult to understand the point.</li>
                    <li>Very cool, easy to use.</li>

                <h2>Your Response</h2>
                <p>
                    Our response to the feedback was to add some additional
                    features while not adding only some. We decided to implement
                    features that wouldn't be that time-consuming while still
                    making the website significantly easier to use. The most
                    significant changes are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change “and generate” text color from white to light
                    blue.</li>
                    <li>Give an error message when the user tries to submit an
                    incorrect hex code.
                    </li>
                    <li>The user can submit the color code when pressing the
                    enter key.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the ability to write the color codes with or without
                    the "#."
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We could further improve the website based on the responses
                by creating a color picker like the one with input with type
                color. It is feasible that this would remove the confusion about
                how hex colors and the website should work.</p>

                <h2>Self Reflection</h2>
                <p>We got an introduction to working with Git in a project
                setting. It has been excellent, even though merging with
                conflicts isn't fun. For many of us, this was also the first
                time programming a “bigger” project in collaboration with other
                students. Due to this, we constantly needed to communicate with
                each other and play on our different strengths. This created a
                great environment to learn a new language and coding principles
                in general.</p>
