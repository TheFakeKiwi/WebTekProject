							<b>The purpose</b> of the website is to provide color schemes
							based upon a user given color.
						</p>
						<p>
							This will be accomplished by having a input field on the home
							page, where the user can enter the color they intend to use for
							the scheme. The colors will then be generated by javascript on the
							backend, and thereafter be shown as div's with a background color
							on the website. The div's will have input fields (for easy
							copying), that is read only, showing the hex value of the colors.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="audience">
						<p>
							The intended audience for the website is designers, UI developers,
							and artists.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-of-site">
						Home page is a basic input field and a button. The main page should
						also have a nav bar and some nice artwork in the background. Upon
						clicking the button, the backend should generate some color schemes,
						and add classes to html elements, to show it's content. Therefore,
						the content of the home page expands after generating the color
						schemes. This will of course be applied to mobile users as well.
